Playing the Game:
1. Connect the headset and plug in the joystick. 
2. Run either application

Space Game Instructions:
The game is split into 3 parts.
You will need to dock a space module in the space station.
There should be numbers on the screen indicating your position and rotation relative to the target. Essentially you want to make those values zero, meaning that the module is docked perfectly. However there is room for error. 
If the module is too far off, then you will have to restart the mission, although as of now, it still says “mission complete”
Use the joystick to move and rotate.
You will control a space arm to get to another point in the space station
Again, there are numbers on the screen indicating your position and rotation relative to the target. 
Use the joystick to move and rotate, although this time, the controls will be different.
You will control a space arm to catch a module in space. 
Same controls as last time, with a different objective
After that, you will take the view of the module, and dock it into the space station, with the arm controls.
As always, make sure the position and rotation values are close to zero.

Mars Game Instructions
You can either play as a rover (rabbit) or a hoverbike (dragon), both with different controls.
You start at the mars space station, where there you follow waypoints and complete objectives.
There are three nuclear power cells on each of the crash sites, so you have to drive to get them and go back to base
However, there are drones coming from space trying to stop you, so you have to use your firepower to defend yourself.
Collect all 3 nuclear power cells and return to base to win the game
